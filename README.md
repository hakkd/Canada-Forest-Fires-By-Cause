**Introduction**\
Backgroud:\
Forest fires are a significant environmental concern in Canada due to the country's vast forested areas and diverse climatic conditions. These fires can have severe ecological, economic, and social impacts on the affected regions. Understanding the causes and patterns of forest fires is essential for developing effective strategies for prevention, mitigation, and response.

About the dataset:\
This dataset contains information on the causes and frequency of forest fires that occurred in various jurisdictions (administrative regions) across Canada from 1990 to 2021, in English and French. The varibles are:
* Year / Année: This column represents the year when the forest fire incidents occurred.
* ISO: This column contains the ISO code corresponding to the specific geographic region or province where each fire incident took place.
* Jurisdiction / Juridiction: This column indicates the administrative region or jurisdiction responsible for the area where the fire incident occurred.
* Cause / Origine: This column categorizes the primary reason behind each fire incident. The causes include Human activity, Lightning, Prescribed burn, Reburn and Unspecified.
* Number / Nombre: This column represents the numerical count of fire incidents recorded for each specific combination of year, ISO code, and cause.
* Data Qualifier / Qualificatifs de données: Data Qualifier: An indicator of data quality or reliability, specifying if the data is provisional, confirmed, or estimated.

The data could be used for various analyses, such as identifying trends in fire incidents, understanding the impact of different causes, and formulating effective fire management and prevention strategies.
